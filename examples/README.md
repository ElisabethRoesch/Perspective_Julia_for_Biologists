This folder contains the six examples described in the first [README.md file](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/blob/main/README.md). They are grouped by their core language design feature they are demonstrating. 
* Speed
  * [Example 1: Speed - Single cell data and network inference](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/blob/main/Examples/Speed/interactive_network_analysis.jl)
  * [Example 2: Speed - Dynamical systems and Lotka-Volterra](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/blob/main/Examples/Speed/lotka_volterra_speed.jl)
* Abstraction
  * [Example 3: Abstraction - Structural bioinformatics ](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/blob/main/Examples/Abstraction/structural_bioinformatics.ipynb)
  * [Example 4: Abstraction - Image processing in Julia](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/tree/main/Examples/Abstraction/images_lazy)
* Metaprogramming
  * [Example 5: Metaprogramming - Biochemical reaction networks](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/blob/main/Examples/Metaprogramming/Dynamical-systems-modeling.ipynb)
