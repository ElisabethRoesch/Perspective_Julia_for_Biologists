This folder contains the six examples described in the first [README.md file](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/blob/main/README.md). They are grouped by their core language design feature they are demonstrating. 
* Speed
  * [Example 1: Speed - Single cell data and network inference](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/tree/main/examples/Speed/Example_Network_Inference_from_Single_Cell_Data)
  * [Example 2: Speed - Dynamical systems and Lotka-Volterra](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/tree/main/examples/Speed/Supplementary_Example_Accelerating_Dynamical_Systems_Modeling_in_Systems_Biology_and_Pharmacology)
* Abstraction
  * [Example 3: Abstraction - Structural bioinformatics](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/tree/main/examples/Abstraction/Example_Structural_bioinformatics_with_composable_packages)
  * [Example 4: Abstraction - Image processing in Julia](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/tree/main/examples/Abstraction/Supplementary_Example_Flexibility_and_performance_in_image_processing)
* Metaprogramming
  * [Example 5: Metaprogramming - Biochemical reaction networks](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists/tree/main/examples/Metaprogramming/Example_Biochemical_reaction_networks)
